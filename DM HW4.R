# We know that values below 0.05 indicates significance, which means the coefficient or so called parameters that are estimated by our model are reliable. 
# And our model fits those variables better
# From the regression model, we see that CHI score Month 0 has the highest significance, followed by Customer Age (in months) and CHI Score 0-1
